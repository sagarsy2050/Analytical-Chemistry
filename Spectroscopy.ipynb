    "\n",
    "*What is a Selection Rule in Spectroscopy? You should describe what is meant by both a Gross and a Specific selection rule and their different effects.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Gross: This is to do with the properties of the molecules, the requiresments of the species to be active to a particular type of spectroscopy, e.g. the presence of a molecular dipole, etc. \n",

    "Specific: This is to do with thte allowed transitions between the quantised energy levels. \n",
