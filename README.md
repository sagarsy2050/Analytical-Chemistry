# Analytical-Chemistry(Python Chemistry)
Future technology called artificial intelligence will change how chemists interact with data. As a result, it is a useful skill that every student of chemistry should have. The course presented here introduces machine learning to chemistry students and is built around a series of Python Notebooks and homework problems..

These notebooks work through:

* 1) Performing simple calculations, and using the math module;
* 2) Working with variables;
* 3) Different data types: integers and floats, strings, lists, and numpy arrays;
* 4) Plotting data with matplotlib;
* 5) Basic data analysis and statistics with numpy.
*
