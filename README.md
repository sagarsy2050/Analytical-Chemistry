# Analytical-Chemistry(Python Chemistry)
Machine Learning, a subdomain of Artificial intelligence, is a pervasive technology that would mold how chemists interact with data. Therefore, it is a relevant skill to incorporate into the toolbox of any chemistry student. This work presents a course that introduces machine learning for chemistry students based on a set of Python Notebooks and assignments.

These notebooks work through:

* 1) Performing simple calculations, and using the math module;
* 2) Working with variables;
* 3) Different data types: integers and floats, strings, lists, and numpy arrays;
* 4) Plotting data with matplotlib;
* 5) Basic data analysis and statistics with numpy.
