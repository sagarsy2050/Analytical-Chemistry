    "This notebook follows on in many ways from the [functions](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/bjmorgan-python_in_chemistry-ty1bfjno/notebooks/General/Functions.ipynb) notebook. The aim here is to show the utility of **loops** in Python programming. I will again endevour to use examples from *chemistry* related problems, but occasionally examples from physics or mathematics will come through. \n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case with many aspects of programming the propose of a loop is to allow the programmer to write less code. This leads to the idiom that *computers are really good at doing the same thing over and over*, much better than humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "A loop really is just that, a way to tell the computer to perform a task multiple times over. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pythonic way to have a loop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>for i in array:\n",
    "    operation\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things here that need described. \n",
    "- <code>for</code> This tells the computer that you are wanting something to be looped through\n",
    "- <code>i</code> This is the iterator, it will become more clear the utility of this in later examples\n",
    "- <code>array</code> This is some array of objects that is to be itereated through. \n",
    "For each iteration the <code>operation</code> is performed. \n",
    "\n",
